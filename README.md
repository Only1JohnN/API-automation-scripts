# Load-Stress-Test-Automation

Welcome to the **Load-Stress-Test-Automation** repository! This project contains automated scripts for load and stress testing to assess and optimize application performance. The repository provides tools and configurations for simulating various load conditions and stress scenarios to ensure system robustness and reliability.

## Features

- **Load Testing**: Simulate normal and peak load conditions using JMeter or Python `pytest` to evaluate application performance under typical usage.
- **Stress Testing**: Assess system behavior under extreme conditions using JMeter or Python `pytest` to identify potential breaking points and performance degradation.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed reports with JMeter and `pytest` to analyze performance metrics and identify bottlenecks.
- **Customizable Configurations**: Easily adjust testing parameters and scenarios to fit different applications and environments.
- **Integration with Pytest**: Utilize `pytest` for running additional custom tests and generating reports.

## Requirements

- **JMeter**: For creating and running load and stress tests.
- **Python**: For custom scripts and integrations.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Used for structuring test automation in a maintainable and scalable way.
- **pytest**: Framework for running Python tests and generating reports.
- **Requests Library**: For making HTTP requests in Python tests.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Only1JohnN/Load-Stress-Test-Automation.git
    cd Load-Stress-Test-Automation
    ```

2. **Create a Python Virtual Environment:**

    To avoid conflicts between dependencies, it's recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using `venv`:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    Activate the virtual environment:

    - **On Windows:**

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - **On macOS/Linux:**

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3. **Install Python Dependencies:**

    Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Install JMeter:**

    Follow the instructions on the [Apache JMeter website](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi) to download and install JMeter.

5. **Configure Your Tests:**

    - **JMeter Tests**: Modify the JMeter configuration files and test scripts according to your application’s requirements. Update parameters such as URLs, endpoints, and test data as needed.

    - **Pytest Tests**: Write or configure your Python test scripts for load and stress testing. Update URLs and parameters in `load_test.py` and `stress_test.py` as needed.

6. **Run Load Tests with JMeter:**

    Execute load testing scripts using JMeter:

    ```bash
    jmeter -n -t jmeter/load_test_script.jmx -l results/load_test_results.jtl
    ```

7. **Run Stress Tests with JMeter:**

    Execute stress testing scripts similarly:

    ```bash
    jmeter -n -t jmeter/stress_test_script.jmx -l results/stress_test_results.jtl
    ```

8. **Run Load Tests with Pytest:**

    Execute Python load tests using `pytest`:

    ```bash
    pytest python/load_test.py
    ```

9. **Run Stress Tests with Pytest:**

    Execute Python stress tests using `pytest`:

    ```bash
    pytest python/stress_test.py
    ```

10. **Review Reports:**

    - **JMeter Reports**: Analyze the `.jtl` results files or use JMeter’s reporting tools to generate detailed performance reports.
    - **Pytest Reports**: Review the output from `pytest` to assess the performance of your application under load and stress conditions.
